                My name is Ruslan. I am 23 years old. I live in the city of Zaporozhye. I've been working as a design engineer for 3 years now, but I'm not enjoying my job as much as I would like to. I am finishing my studies at ZNU National Engineering Institute at the end of this year. I want to become a web developer, create my own websites, applications and various services. I am studying at the freshcode educational center. After graduation, I want to immediately start working in this field. Because I like it. I am also into sports. My hobby is football. I played football for 10 years, but due to an injury I had to stop doing it.
